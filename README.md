🪙 Bitcoin Historical Data & Market Trends Analysis

📌 Project Overview
This project provides a deep dive into the historical trading data of Bitcoin (BTC) during its early formative years (2011–2013). By analyzing total volume, currency fluctuations, and price weighting, the dashboard explores the initial stages of market adoption and the extreme price volatility that characterizes the cryptocurrency market.

📊 Key Insights
Explosive Growth: The "Total Volume Currency" grew from nearly zero in 2011 to $1.53bn by 2013, showcasing the rapid influx of capital into the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Price Volatility: The weighted price analysis reveals a massive surge in 2013, with the Average Weighted Price jumping from ~$10 to over **$247** within a single year.

Trading Patterns: Friday and Wednesday emerged as the highest volume trading days, with Friday leading at $12.26M in total weighted price activity.

Volume Peaks: November and December consistently showed the highest monthly trading volumes (BTC), indicating strong end-of-year market interest during the 2012-2013 period.

🛠️ Technical Toolkit
Interactive Visualization: Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard utilizing Treemaps, Waterfall charts, and Gauge visuals for price thresholds.

Advanced Metrics: Used DAX to calculate complex market indicators:

Total Weighted Price: Providing a more accurate average price based on trading volume.

Currency vs. BTC Volume: Comparing the actual coins traded against their equivalent currency value.

Max/Min Weighted Price Gauges: Visualizing the extreme "highs" ($2.33K) and "lows" ($3.8) of the historical period.

Time-Series Analysis: Leveraged Date Hierarchies to break down performance by Year, Month, and Day of the Week.
